Experiment Description	Radiotherapy has a critical role in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Effectiveness of radiation in SCLC remains limited as resistance results from defects in apoptosis. In the current study, we investigated whether using a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor S44563 can enhance radiosensitivity of SCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies confirmed that S44563 induce apoptosis in SCLC cells by inducing hallmarks of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, sub-G1 fraction induction and induction of the mitochondrial caspase activation pathway). S44563 markedly enhanced sensitivity of H146 cells and H69 cells to radiation in clonogenic assay. In addition, the combination S44563 and cisplatin-based chemo-radiation showed a dramatic tumor growth delay and increased overall survival in mouse xenograft models. In vitro experiments demonstrated a greater induction of apoptosis (sub-G1 fraction and cleaved caspase-3) with the combination as well as in vivo caspase-3 immunostaining. This positive interaction between S44563 and radiation was greater when S44563 was given after the completion of the radiation, which may be explained by the radiation-induced over expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) through the NF-?B pathway activation.  Taken together, these data underline the critical role of sequence administration of targeted therapies with conventional therapies. SCLC cells which survive to IR highly rely on the induction of anti apoptotic proteins in part through NF- ?B activation for their survival yielding to the concept of 'contextual oncogene addiction' to the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL pathway providing rational for targeting survival pathways to potentiate IR. For transcriptome analysis,  106 cells were seeded in T25 flasks, allowed to growth for 24 h, and then left untreated or treated with 2 Gy radiation. After 24 hours, cells were harvested, lysed for the extraction of RNA, and processed to analyze gene expression.The design of this study consists to 6 hybridizations in dual color with Agilent Human Genome 4x44K (design 014850). The reference is always the untreated condition.

Protocol Description	Human SCLC cell lines, H146, H69 and H196 were purchased from ATCC. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Inc., France), 100 units/ml of penicillin and 10 000 µg/ml of streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.	Cells were irradiated at room temperature using a 200-kV X-ray irradiator at a dose rate of 0.85 Gy/min. For in vivo irradiation, radiation was given using mouse jigs designed to expose only the tumour bed to radiation at a dose rate of 1.1 Gy/min	RNA were extracted with Qiagen protocol (Qiagen mini kit). The quantity and purity of the extracted RNA was evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and its integrity measured using an Agilent Bioanalyzer	Agilent oligo Cy5 or Cy3 probes labelling protocol. Kit used for probe labelling: Quick Amp Labeling  Kit adapted for small amount of total RNA. In 1.5 ml tubes add 500 ng total RNA from sample. Add 1.2 ul T7 promoter primer, 2ul Spike-in A for Cy3 labelling or B for Cy5 labelling and add nuclease free water (Invitrogen ref:10977-015) to bring the volume to 11 ul. Denature by incubating at 65°C for 10 minutes. Place the reactions on ice and incubate 5 min. Spin briefly. Prepare a Reverse Transcription master mix, adding for one reaction 4 ul First strand Buffer 5X, 2 ul DTT 0.1M, 1 ul dNTP 10 mM mix, 0.5 ul Random Hexamer, 1 ul MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/ul), 0.5 ul RNAse out (40 U/ul), 1 ul nuclease free water. Master mix is prepared in batch for all the samples included in the study (vol per one reaction multiplied by number of samples. In each reaction tube containing denaturated RNA and T7 promoter primer in a volume of 11 ul, add 9 ul of Reverse Transcriptase master mix, and mix by gently pipetting. Incubate at 40°C in a circulating water bath for 2 hours. Move samples to 65 °C for 15 minutes to inactivate MMLV RT, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. Spin briefly. Prepare a in vitro transcription master mix, adding for one reaction : 20.1 ul Nuclease free water, 20 ul Transcription buffer 4X, 6 ul DTT 0.1 M, 8 ul NTP mix, 0.5 ul RNAse out, 0.6 ul Inorganic Pyrophosphatase, 0.8 ul T7 RNA Polymerase. Transcription master mix is prepared in batch for all the samples included in the study: (vol per one reaction multiplied by number of samples). Master mix is splited in two aliquots, one for Cy5 and one for Cy3. Add 1.6 ul (multiplied by reactions number) CTP-Cy5 25 mM (Perkin Elmer ref NEL 581) or 2.4 ul CTP-Cy3 (multiplied by reactions number) (Perkin Elmer, ref NEL 582) to a total volume of 60 ul/ reaction. To each RT reaction, add 60 ul Transcription master mix. Incubate at 40°C for 3 hours. Add 20 ul nuclease free water and freeze at –20°C. Labeled probes are purified using Qiagen Rneasy mini kit and protocol provided by Agilent. For each probe, add 350 ul RLT buffer, and 250 ul ethanol 100°. Mix by gently vortexing. Apply 700 ul on Rneasy columns and spin at 13,000 g for 30 s at 4°C. Discard flow-through. Wash twice with RPE buffer. Dry the column and elute in 60 ul nuclease free water. Measure concentration and Cy5/Cy3 incorporation using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Adjust concentration at 100 ng/ul. Freeze at –20°C until hybridisation.	Agilent Hybridization Protocol (Chamber type: Agilent SureHyb Chamber; Quantity of labelled extract: 825 ng per labelling ; duration: 17 hours; volume: 100 ul per array; Temperature in °C: 65). Add the following components in clean 1.5 ml tubes: 825 ng linearly amplified cRNA labeled with Cy5 for sample 1, and 825 ng linearly amplified cRNA labeled with Cy3 for sample 2. Conversely, for dye swapped arrays, mix 825 ng linearly amplified cRNA labelled with Cy3 for sample1, and 825 ng linearly amplified cRNA labeled with Cy5 for sample 2. In each case, add 50 ul Bocking Agent 10X, 10 ul of Fragmentation buffer 25X and nuclease free water up to 250 ul. Mix by vortexing. Incubate at 60°C for 30 minutes in dark. Spin briefly, add 250 ul of 2X hi-hybridization buffer. Mix gently. Assembly the Sure-Hyb hybridization chamber from Agilent. Place a backing side with the plastic inner on upper side. Gently add 490 ul of 1x hybridisation solution and cover with the Agilent 244k exon array properly oriented (active surface in contact with liquid). Finish to assembly the chamber and tight the screw. Hybridization was carried out for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Mountain View, CA) at 10 rpm. The arrays were disassembled at room temperature in wash 1 buffer (Agilent), then washed 1 minute in a glass dish (Wheathon) at room temperature in wash 1 buffer, then 1 minute in wash 2 buffer at 37°C and then 1 minute in acetonitril. Slides were scanned by using an Agilent G2565 C DNA microarray scanner	Scanning perform with a Agilent G2505C DNA Microarray scanner using default parameters : 20 bits mode, 3 um resolution, at 20 C in low ozone concentration environment. Microarray images were analysed by using Feature Extraction software version ( 10.5.1.1) from Agilent technologies. Defaults settings were used.  Raw data files from the Agilent Feature Extraction software 10.5.1.1 for image analysis were imported into Resolver(TM) system (version 7.2.2.0) for gene expression data analyses from Rosetta Inpharmatics. Then, in dye_swap experiments, combined experiments were generated to obtain average values from the dye swap experiments in order to avoid dye incorporation bias.
